                Engineer rows to work on Liberty Bay

            <h4>

            <p>
                Row-row-row your boat gently down the stream; merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.
            </p>

            <p>
             Many of us can undoubtedly pull a few second-grade rounds of this old song out of our memory banks. 
             How many can claim this song to be the essence of their daily commute?
            </p>

            <p>
                Neil Sirman is one such person who rows to and from work every day. An Electronics Engineer in Code 5421,
                 he claims "it's the best commute in the whole United States."
            </p>

            <p>For Neil, rowing to work is quite the natural thing to do since he lives on a sail boat in the Poulsbo Yacht Club Marina. 
                Neil started work at Keyport about a year and a half ago and for the first six month commuted in a car pool. 
                Then last April he started making the daily two-mile jaunt on Liberty Bay, mooring his boat at the Keyport Marina.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            The boat is a 15 foot Dory with a New England lobster fishing design "a real rowing boat." Said Neil,
             "I feel like I'm as comfortable as a person in a car seat, only much safer... and the boat starts every morning!"
            </p>

            <p>
                But just how 'comfortable' can it be on a cold wintery morning? This hearty individual doesn't seem to be bothered 
                by adverse weather situations. "In mid winter when I was on the water," he noted, 
                "it wasn't nearly as cold as it was out of the boat walking (to the Base)."
            </p>

            <p>
                A strong South wind is just about the only condition that keeps Neil out of his Dory in the morning. A thick fog won't deter him.
                 The first time he set out in a fog, he got "lost," and it took him 55 minutes to make the usual 30 minute trip. 
                 He remedied the problem from then on by using a compass.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another difficult condition arises when the tide is moving in (or out, depending on which way Neil is rowing). But knowledge of the tidal patterns has been helpful for Neil, 
                who knows what part of the bay is best to row on during any situation. "You learn to play the currents," he noted.
            </p>

            <p>
                One might expect that he put himself through a rigorous training program prior to beginning his daily commute. But he didn't. 
                According to Neil, rowing is not a tiring activity that requires the participant be in top physical shape.
                 "It's like riding a bicycle at moderate speed on level ground." 
            </p>

            <p>
                Neil finds the commute to be a "good, meditative time." Right at dawn, he enjoys the natural colors and wildlife. 
                "When I first started rowing," he said, "seals would follow me, but they've gotten used to me by now."
                Rowing to work on clear days he has a view of the Olympic Mountains and going home he faces Mount Rainier. Added Neil. 
                "I wouldn't give up this commute for anything."
