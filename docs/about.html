            Project V1: I created the basic layout and structure of my home and about pages.
            I added an image to the home page, as well as a basic header and an unordered navigation list.
        </p>
        <p id="V2">
            Project V2: I added the 1910's History and 1980's History Pages to my site. I added the Neil Sirman
             article to my 1980's History page. I continued to develop my home and about pages. I used CSS to continue 
             to style page elements such as adding gradients. I also adjusted the positioning of some page elements. May 8th, 2021.
        </p>
        <p id="V3">
            Project V3: I added a table to my home page containg the different name changes of NUWC, 
            Division Keyport. I added a pull-down menu to my home page. I also used media queries to format my header image on my home page differently for phones.
        </p>
        <p>
            Project V4: I added a video to my 1910's History page with some photos of the Naval Torpedo Station in the 1910s. I also embedded a YouTube 
            video that briefly talks about the various warfare centers/divisions around the county. I resized my home page header image, and center aligned
            all of my h1 text. Finally, I added a spin animation to all of my h2 headings.
